![alt text](https://github.com/nslewis/Voice-Controlled-Light-Switch/blob/main/Light_Switch.jpg)
Using an ESP8266 connected to Alexa, we can control a servo which turns the light switch on or off. Light switch is connected to the servo arm using zipties. Looking to 3D print a fixture in the future to make it cleaner and more reliable. 

## Required
1x Servo Motor (SG90 used here)
1x ESP32/8266 (ESP8266 used here)

## Dependencies 
Assuming the libraries for the ESP32/8266 are included. 
The fauxmoESP library is required. Reference https://github.com/vintlabs/fauxmoESP for what is needed.

## Installation
Just upload the AutomaticLightSwitch.ino file to your ESP8266 and provided the connections are made correctly it should work as intended.
